Katie Ledecky was born on March 17, 1997:\n- Age 20: March 17, 2017 - March 16, 2018\n- Age 21: March 17, 2018 - March 16, 2019\n- Age 22: March 17, 2019 - March 16, 2020\n- Age 23: March 17, 2020 - March 16, 2021\n- Age 24: March 17, 2021 - March 16, 2022\n- Age 25: March 17, 2022 - March 16, 2023\n- Age 26: March 17, 2023 - March 16, 2024\n- Age 27: March 17, 2024 - March 16, 2025\n- Age 28: March 17, 2025 - March 16, 2026\n- Age 29: March 17, 2026 - March 16, 2027\n\nLooking at the data, she needs to have been between 20 and 29 years old when the medal was won. Since we only have year information (not exact dates), I need to be careful. However, typically for this kind of question, we would consider the year she turned 20 through the year she turned 29.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. \"In her twenties\" means ages 20-29. Since we only have years, not exact dates, I'll need to determine which years she was in her twenties for at least part of that year:\n- Born March 17, 1997\n- Turned 20 in 2017\n- Turned 30 in 2027\n\nSo medals from years 2017-2026 inclusive would count (she would have been in her twenties for at least part of those years).\n\nFrom the data available, the years we have are: 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023.\n\nLet me count the medals:",
