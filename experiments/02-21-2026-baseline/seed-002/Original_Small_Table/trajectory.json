The most reasonable interpretation is \"2 appearances / 2 wins\" or just \"2/2\" since both are 2.\n\nLet me look at the question one more time: \"How many African Championships appearances/wins does Ferdinand Omanyala have?\"\n\nI think the answer should be formatted as \"2 appearances / 2 wins\" or more simply as \"2/2\". But if I need to give a single number, it would be \"2\" (assuming they're asking for the count which is the same for both).\n\nActually, re-reading the question format with the slash, I believe the answer should be in the format: \"X appearances / Y wins\" or \"X/Y\". Since both are 2, the answer would be \"2/2\" or \"2 appearances / 2 wins\".\n\nLet me create the final query and save the results:",
